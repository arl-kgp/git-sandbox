# git-sandbox
A place to practice Git commands.

Your first exercise is to add your name to this list. To do so, first go through
the [curated list of git
resources](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/)
provided by GitHub and learn to use git. Then fork the respository, create
a new branch and add your name and send a pull request. Your entry should
maintain the alphabetic order and it should be in the format `your name <email
id>`.
